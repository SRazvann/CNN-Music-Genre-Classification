# CNN-Music-Genre-Classification

The CNN network was trained using the GTZAN dataset. In order to get a higher accuracy I've split the songs in parts that equal 5 seconds each. The resulted test accuracy was around ~79%, as can be seen in the notebook. An even higher accuracy can be obtained by splitting the songs in smaller parts. The neural network can be tested in the .py web app by uploading local drive songs or using preloaded ones.
